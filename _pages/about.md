About me
======
Jiaxin Jessie Wang is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Special Education at Vanderbilt University, Peabody College of Education. Her passion for supporting students and families from racially minoritized backgrounds stems from her own experiences as a multilingual immigrant, public school student, and teacher. 

Jessie’s research exists at the intersection of special education, race, and education policy. She uses critical quantitative methods and leverages secondary data to answer questions surrounding disproportionality in disability identification and factors related to such disparities. 

Before starting her doctoral program, Jessie was a middle school special education teacher and she also has experience in nonprofit, advocacy, and government settings. She earned her Special Education M.Ed. from Vanderbilt University and her Psychology B.S. from the University of Florida.
